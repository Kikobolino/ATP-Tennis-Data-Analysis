## Introduction

The Analysis looks into the ATP Tennis Data for the years 2002 to 2022 (as at 06.06.22)
Using this data I performed tasks to explore relationships, visualize geographic data, perform basic supervised and unsupervised machine learning.

## Key Questions and Objectives

Who is the most successful player on the ATP Tour in the last 20 years?
How many countries of the world have hosted ATP tournaments?
Which country has collected the most titles?
Which other factors contribute to successful performances?

## Results and Visualizations
